# Wildlife-Park

It's a website made for a Wildlife Park in Canada, which is not real at all. This website is onepage site which was made with HTML, Sass 
and JQuery. In feature I'm planning to add real descriptions of animals instead of Lorem Ipsum text and maybe add sections with plants.
Most important thing, that I'm planning to do next, is making this site responsive, for now it only looks good on desktops.
